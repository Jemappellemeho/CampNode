## Semantic Learning Graph

A graph-based learning platform that structures course content using semantic knowledge graphs and AI.

### Concept

Professors define core course topics.
The system automatically:

Fetches related concepts from Wikidata / DBpedia

Builds a semantic learning graph

Retrieves external learning resources

Generates AI-based quizzes per topic

Students navigate the course as a visual graph, complete quizzes to unlock nodes, and track their learning progress.

### Goal

To transform unstructured topic lists into guided, prerequisite-based learning paths powered by semantic data and AI.
